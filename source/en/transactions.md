## Overview

This partnership gives Invoice Ninja users worldwide access to major banks and enables them to connect their bank accounts for automatic reconciliation of payments and expenses.

For enterprise hosted users, the Connect Accounts button allows you to add, update, and remove accounts from Invoice Ninja. Clicking on this button will take you to the Yodlee platform where you can securely authenticate with your bank and select the accounts you wish to link with Invoice Ninja.

Once your bank account is connected, you have the option to enable automatic syncing, which will keep all of your transactions up to date. If you prefer, you can also manually create bank accounts and transactions, or import bank statements in CSV format (Settings > Import | Export).
