# Frequently Asked Questions

Here you will find answers to many frequently asked questions about Invoice Ninja.

### What is the Client Portal?

- When you send a client an invoice, the email contains a link to view the invoice online in the client portal.
- The client portal is an online self-serve dashboard for your client to see their invoices, make payments, download statements, manage subscriptions, payment methods, and more.
- Client portal access is available for all your clients. You can optionally allow anyone to register as a new client under Settings>Client Portal>Registration.
- If you enable "Client Initiated Payments" under Settings>Payment Settings, you can even allow your clients to make a payment online without you having to send an invoice (you can also set the "Minimum Payment Amount" for client-initiated payments)
- You can see how the client portal looks for your clients by clicking the "Client Portal" option:

![Client portal](/assets/images/clients/client_portal.png "Client portal")

See [Client Portal](/en/client-portal)

### What is a subdomain?

- The subdomain is used in the client portal to personalize links to match your brand. Ex., https://your-brand.invoicing.co
- Under Settings>Client Portal, you can setup your subdomain.
- Links generated in the system (invoices, quotes, etc.) that are sent to your clients will use the subdomain you have configured.
- If you have multiple companies, you can set a different subdomain for each company. Ex., companya.invoicing.co, companyb.invoicing.co… that way, each company has its own branding and custom link.

### How can I accept payments online? What is a payment gateway (AKA, merchant processor)?

- Accepting online payments has never been easier. Invoice Ninja integrates with all the major online payment gateways to let you accept payments in 135+ currencies: [Payment Gateway Integrations](https://invoiceninja.com/payments/)
- In order to accept payments online, you need to integrate your Invoice Ninja account with a "payment gateway."

  ![Payment email options](/assets/images/settings/payment_email_options.png "Payment email options")

### I have some clients in different countries. How can I make an invoice in a different currency?

- The default currency selected when making a new client is determined by the "Currency" you set in Settings>Localization>Currency.
- When you Add or Edit a client, you have the option to change the currency for the client.

  ![Client settings additional info - currency](/assets/images/clients/client_additional_info_currency.png "Client settings additional info - currency")

- If your configured [Payment Gateway](/en/gateways) supports the currency, the client will be able to pay in that currency. Payments will record the currency they paid in.
- You are able to report your revenues/payments by currency in the dashboard, and reports.

  ![Dashboard filter by currency](/assets/images/dashboard/dashboard_filter_by_currency.png "Dashboard filter by currency")

- If you have a group of clients that you'd like to bill in a specific currency, or apply other settings to a group of clients, you can use the Groups feature in Invoice Ninja – see: [Group Settings for Client Management](/en/clients/#group-settings-for-client-management)
  - Groups lets you customize any setting or templates (ex. invoice templates) to tailor to your group of clients. For example, if you want a different invoice design or email for your "USD Clients" you can configure that easily with Groups.

### How to Setup Taxes?

- Invoice Ninja supports virtually all forms of charging/recording tax.
- You can even apply 1 to 3 tax rates together.
- Taxes can be setup for invoices and expenses
  - Invoice tax is tax you charge a client
  - Expense tax is tax you recorded that you paid on an expense to a vendor (Ex. purchased equipment and X % was spent on Y tax)
- You'll first want to go to Settings>Tax Settings>New Tax Rate, and add your tax name and percentage.
- Then you select the way in which you wish to apply the tax rate to your invoices/expenses by default:
  - Invoice Tax Rates
  - If you do not select a tax rate to apply by default, you will have to select the tax rate manually when creating an invoice/expense.
  - Line-item taxation is also supported. When enabled, this will add column(s) to the invoice for the line item tax rate(s) - you can select one to three line item tax rates.
- You can also toggle whether taxes are inclusive or exclusive.
- You can also set a tax category for your each product. That way, you can report which tax category the tax was charge for based on the products you sold. For example, "Physical Goods", "Tax Exempt"…
- See full instructions and videos for tax configuration: [Taxes](/en/taxes)

### How can I create individual logins to Invoice Ninja for my staff to make invoices and use features, but not see my business's total revenues or reporting?

- You can manage your additional account users under _Settings>User Management_.

  ![User Management](/assets/images/settings/settings_user_management.png "User Management")

- When creating a New Account User, you can go under Permissions and select which areas of the system the user will have access to. If you don't want them to see any reports or analytics, don't check 'View Dashboard' or 'Reports'.

### What happens when I email an invoice out to the client?

- When you email an invoice from Invoice Ninja, the client receives an email which allows them to open and view the invoice online, and make a payment.
- The payment can be made in the client portal via your configured payment gateway(s)
- The email is sent according to the "Invoice" template that you can fully customize under _Settings>Templates & Reminders_

  ![Invoice email template](/assets/images/settings/default_invoice_email_template.png "Invoice email template")
