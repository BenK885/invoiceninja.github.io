# Import and Export

## Import Data

You can import data into Invoice Ninja from CSV files or other accounting software.

Our intelligent import system allows you to map columns dynamically.

First start by uploading your file to the correct category and click Import.

This will upload the file and we will perform column matching a return you to a new page.

Here we match the column from the CSV (left column) with the matching Invoice Ninja columns (right columns). From here you can adjust the mappings and when they look correct, click on Import.

The system will then process the CSV file and email you the results of the import.
