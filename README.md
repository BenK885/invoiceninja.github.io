### Introduction

Invoice Ninja documentation is written in the markdown. To process and compile docs locally, we'll need PHP &
Node.js.

The documentation is using Laravel Jigsaw (https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) as a processing engine.

### Getting started

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja.github.io.git
```

#### Change directory and install dependencies

```bash
cd invoiceninja.github.io
composer i
npm i
```

#### Preview it

```bash
npm run watch
vendor/bin/jigsaw serve
```

Now you should be able to edit & preview your changes in real-time.

The official repository is configured to build the site on each commit, so there's no need to compile the production version
locally.
